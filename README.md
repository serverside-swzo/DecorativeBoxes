## Decorative Boxes
**Decorative Boxes** is a simple mod that I created to add various wooden boxes purely for decoration to Minecraft. These boxes are designed to enhance the aesthetic of builds and were inspired by my personal survival world.

### Added Boxes:
- **Oak Box**
- **Spruce Box**
- **Birch Box**
- **Jungle Box**
- **Acacia Box**
- **Dark Oak Box**
- **Mangrove Box**
- **Cherry Box**
- **Bamboo Box**
- **Crimson Box**
- **Warped Box**

### Features:
- **Purely Decorative**: These boxes have no gameplay impact beyond enhancing the look of your builds.
- **Wide Variety**: Each wood type in Minecraft has a corresponding decorative box to match.
- **Simple Crafting**: All wooden boxes are crafted using the respective wood type.
- **Serverside**: Use Polymer so no client side mods are required

### Dependencies:
- **Minecraft**: 1.21 - 1.21.1 compatible.
- **[Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer)**: 0.9.14+
- **[Filament](https://modrinth.com/mod/filament)**: 0.8.4+
